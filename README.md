### Prerequisites

There are several prerequisites you will need to deploy Amazon WorkSpaces in bulk.

** Note ** You can get this information if you use the Amazon WorkSpace Console to create 1 test WorkSpace instance.

You have to create a comma seprated value file (CSV) with this format:

```
DirectoryId,UserName,BundleId,KMSKey
```
The values contains:

- The Amazon WorkSpaces Drirectory to use
- A set of Amazon WorkSpaces Directory users
- The Amazon WorkSpaces Bundlel id to use
- An Amazon KMS key for encryption

  The WorkSpace information is located in the Amazon WorkSpaces console

  The KMS information is located in the Amazon KMS console (copy the ARN)

Once you have the information needed your CSV file should look like this.

```
DirectoryId,UserName,BundleId,KMSKey
d-YourDirectoryId,scwpuser001,wsb-8vbljg4r6,arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:youraccount:key/9c631fc8-6b-YOUR-KEY-84a06dfd3
d-YourDirectoryId,scwpuser002,wsb-8vbljg4r6,arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:youraccount:key/9c631fc8-6b-YOUR-KEY-84a06dfd3
```

- Upload the file to an Amazon S3 bucket in your account
- Make note of:
  - The **bucket name** e.g. mybucket123
  - The **key of your file** e.g content/keyfile.csv
